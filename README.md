# ITS-TIME

HMI7540 PYTHON PROJECT

A medication reminder application that gives the user an alert of what medication to take and when to take it.  Additional functionalities may include a drug identifier, last pharmacy filled identifier, and expiration date.

IT’S TIME uses information technology combined with user input to ease the burden of remembering to take medications correctly and on time. Features of this software includes:
•	Automatic alert system reminder of what medications to take 
•	 What time to take medication (noon, before lunch, etc.,)
•	Instructions on how to take medication (Dosing)
•	Expiration dates of medication
•	Last Pharmacy medication was filled
•	Request refills based on last fill date
•	A drug identifier in case a patient wants to, confirm a manufacturer, check if a medication is recalled, changes in appearance, etc.…



Below are some code links and a brief description, along with input, that may be combined with new code to create a software application that can be used alongside a patient’s prescription profile to complete IT’S TIME.
